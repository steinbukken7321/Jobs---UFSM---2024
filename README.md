## Working in C and matlab with complex numbers

This repository contains C implementations for performing operations with complex numbers, such as generating vectors and matrices of complex values, as well as disk read and write operations.

## Assignment 1: Complex Value Vectors

### Execution Steps:

1. **Generating Complex Vectors**:
   - Run the program to generate complex number vectors.
   - The values of the real and imaginary parts are calculated as specified.

2. **Writing to Disk**:
   - The complex vectors are written to a binary file.

3. **Reading Vectors**:
   - Read the vectors from the binary file on disk.

4. **Comparison and Consistency**:
   - Compare the read values with the originally generated values.
   - Verify the numerical consistency between the read values and the original values.


## Assignment 2: Complex Value matrices

### Execution Steps:

1. **Generating Complex Matrices**:
   - Run the program to generate complex number matrices.
   - The values of the real and imaginary parts are calculated as specified.

2. **Writing to Disk**:
   - The complex matrix is written to a binary file, including information about the matrix size.

3. **Reading Matrices**:
   - Read the matrix from the binary file on disk.

4. **Comparison and Consistency**:
   - Compare the read values with the originally generated values.
   - Verify the numerical consistency between the read values and the original values.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your machine to compile the code in addition to matlab.
