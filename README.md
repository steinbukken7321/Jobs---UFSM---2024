## Working in C and matlab with complex numbers

This repository contains C implementations for performing operations with complex numbers, such as generating vectors and matrices of complex values, as well as disk read and write operations.

## Work 1: Complex Value Vectors

### To execution:
- Generate vectors of complex numbers with real and imaginary parts calculated as specified.
- Write these vectors to disk in a binary format.
- Read the vectors from the disk and compare them with the original values.
- Demonstrate consistency between the values ​​read and the values ​​originally generated.


## Work 2: Complex Value matrices

### To execution:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your machine to compile the code in addition to matlab.
